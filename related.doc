We are not aware of other initiatives that aim at developing a rich
web-based development environment for Prolog. We do not compare SWISH
with traditional editor or GUI based development environments for Prolog
because web-based environments provide new opportunities and pose new
challenges. Instead, we discuss three applications that have served as
inspiration for SWISH: JSFiddle,\footnote{\url{https://jsfiddle.net/}}
R-Studio\footnote{\url{http://www.rstudio.com/}} and IPython
Notebook.\footnote{\url{http://ipython.org/notebook.html}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
As stated, the initial inspiration for SWISH was JSFiddle. Unlike
JSFiddle though, Prolog is executed on the server rather than in the
browser.

\item
R-Studio \cite{gandrud2013reproducible} is an interface to the R
statistical package. Although not a web application, it is based on the
Qt webkit framework and uses web based technology in the background.
R-Studio came into the picture when the COMMIT/ project provided a grant
for developing SWISH as a toolkit for analysis of relational (SQL) data.
The R-studio interface has a similar layout as SWISH, providing a source
window, a console and an output plane that typically shows results in
tables or charts.

\item
IPython Notebook \cite{rossant2013learning} allows mixing markdown or
HTML text with Python sources. The rendered Notebook shows the text,
sources and possible results in the form of numbers, tables or charts.
\end{itemize}

SWISH embodies most of the ideas behind JSFiddle and R-Studio. Embedding
of SWISH in documents is demonstrated in \secref{lpn}. Interactive
editing of documents that embed SWISH is discussed in future work
(\secref{future}).

Both R-Studio and IPython Notebook work on the basis of
\jargon{authentication} (either to the OS or application), after which
any command may be executed.  SWISH can operate both as a public service
granting access to non-intrusive queries and as an authenticated service
to run arbitrary queries, for example for maintenance purposes.  See
\secref{cliopatria}.
