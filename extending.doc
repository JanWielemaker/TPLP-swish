\section{Extending SWISH}
\label{sec:extending}

SWISH can be extended to support languages built on top of Prolog. We
assume that the new language uses Prolog syntax, typically extended with
additional operators. We also assume we still have a \jargon{program}
and queries about this program that have zero, one or more answers. An
extension consists of:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Provide syntax highlighting support for the target
          language.
    \item Provide additional \jargon{answer rendering} plugins.
    \item Change the program or notebook \jargon{profiles}
    \item Add notebooks and programs that provide examples.
\end{itemize}
