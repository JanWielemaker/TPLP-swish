\section{Using SWISH in Prolog education}
\label{sec:edu}

The educational potential of SWISH was immediately obvious. First of all
it provides a sufficiently rich Prolog environment for basic educational
needs without installing software. The relatively simple and modern web
interface appears to be more appealing to students.  SWISH allows for
students to save their assignment as anonymous program and send a link
to their teacher.

The next obvious application is to exploit the ability to embed SWISH
using an \elem{iframe} element into existing online course material. The
first example was created by us for Learn Prolog
Now!\footnote{\url{http://www.learnprolognow.org}}. Learn Prolog Now! is
an online version of a Prolog book by Patrick Blackburn, Johan Bos, and
Kristina Striegnitz \cite{blackburn2006learn}. We established a proof of
concept that embeds SWISH in the online course
material.\footnote{\url{http://lpn.swi-prolog.org}} It is realised as a
Prolog hosted \jargon{proxy} that fetches the pages from the main site
and serves the enhanced pages to the user. The proxy identifies and
classifies the code fragments in terms of `source code' `queries' and
dependencies. Next, it adds a button to the source fragments that, when
pressed, replaces the HTML \elem{pre} element with in \elem{iframe}
running SWISH filled with the source while the example queries are added
to the \textsf{Examples} menu (\figref{lpn}). The queries are executed
by \url{http://swish.swi-prolog.org}. The proxy server served 304,205
pages (user pages, excluding javascript, css and images) during 2016.

	     that shows the collected source as well as example queries
	     from the subsequent text that are classified as relating to
	     this source.  The embedded SWISH provides all functionality
	     available in the stand-alone SWISH. If the user presses the
	     close button, SWISH is removed and the original code
	     re-appears.}

A recent example of this class is \textit{Simply Logical} by Peter
Flach. This book has been republished
online.\footnote{\url{http://book.simply-logical.space/}}

From private mail exchange we know that several universities run local
copies of SWISH to support education. We have no information on the
scale and whether or not this concerns customized versions, for example
preloaded with examples and assignments.
