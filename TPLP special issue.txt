Special Issue of Theory and Practice of Logic Programming
-- User-Oriented Logic Programming and Reasoning Paradigms --

Since the emergence of logic reasoning paradigms, such as answer set
programming, constraint logic programming, probabilistic logic programming,
abductive logic programming, inductive logic programming, and argumentation,
much theoretical work has been done, for example concerning different semantics
and their properties.
More recently, implementations and IDEs emerged which have proven useful in
various problem-solving applications.
However, user-friendliness is still an issue, both for users who are logic
programming experts and non-expert users who simply apply logic paradigms in
problem-solving applications; for example, experts benefit from features like
debugging and heuristic tuning, non-experts from educational material,
explanations, and intuitive visualisations - all of which are ongoing topics of
research.

The goal of this special issue is to discuss different aspects involved in
making logic reasoning paradigms more user-friendly:
1. Describe cutting-edge developments (e.g., novel IDEs, debugging techniques,
visualisations, or methods for heuristic tuning) of both practical and/or
theoretical nature;
2. Provide well-thought assessments of the state of the art (e.g., in the form
of well-organised surveys or personal perspectives);
3. Describe new research directions, offering clear motivations, new
perspectives, and solid foundations for other researchers to build upon
(e.g. best practice or logic programming education)
