  abstract = {The distribution semantics is one of the most prominent approaches for the combination of logic programming and probability theory. Many languages follow this semantics, such as Independent Choice Logic, PRISM, pD, Logic Programs with Annotated Disjunctions (LPADs)  and ProbLog.

When a program contains functions symbols, the distribution semantics
is well\--defined only if the set of explanations for a query is
finite and so is each explanation. Well\--definedness is usually
either explicitly imposed or is achieved by severely limiting the
class of allowed programs.
In this paper we identify a larger class of programs for which the
semantics is well\--defined together with an efficient procedure for
computing the probability of queries.
Since LPADs offer the most general syntax, we present our results for
them, but our results are applicable to all languages under the
distribution semantics.

We present the algorithm ``Probabilistic Inference with Tabling and
Answer subsumption'' (PITA) that computes the probability of
queries by transforming a probabilistic program into a normal program
and then applying SLG resolution with answer subsumption.
PITA has been implemented in XSB and tested on six domains: two
with function symbols and four without.  The execution times are
compared with those of ProbLog, cplint and
CVE. PITA was almost always able to solve larger problems in a
shorter time, on domains with and without function symbols.},
