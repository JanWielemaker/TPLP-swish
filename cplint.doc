\subsection{The \cplintonswish{} system}
\label{sec:cplint}

\cplintonswish{}\footnote{\url{http://cplint.ml.unife.it}}
\cite{RigBelLam16-SPE-IJ,AlbBelCot17-IA-IJ} is an
extension of SWISH for experimenting with
Probabilistic Logic Programming (PLP)
\cite{DBLP:journals/ml/RaedtK15},
the integration of logic programming with probability theory.
\cplintonswish{} provides a web interface to the \cplint{} system.

PLP is still a relatively new field and its user base is still growing.
One obstacle to its widespread adoption is the difficulty in the installation
of the various PLP systems. For example, \cplint{} is a distributed as
a SWI-Prolog
pack but its installation
requires the
compilation of an external C library together with
the CUDD library\footnote{\url{http://vlsi.colorado.edu/~fabio/}}
for handling Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs). The compilation
is not automatic on some platforms, such as Windows, and requires
manual intervention. This may represent a hurdle for some users.
\cplintonswish{} allows users to try \cplint{} without installing
anything on their machines, thus offering the opportunity to
quickly get a feeling of what PLP is and what \cplint{}
can do. Moreover, the possibility of saving, sharing and discussing
programs also
allows users to experiment with the system in a collaborative way,
which is particularly important when learning a new technology.

For example, \cplintonswish{} is used at the University of Ferrara
for teaching Statistical Relational Artificial Intelligence:
students are given assignment whose solution is a program in PLP
that they can develop in \cplintonswish{} and
submit by saving it in the system and sending the URL to
the instructor.
Therefore SWISH plays a very important role in the dissemination
and promotion of PLP in general and \cplint{} in particular.

\cplintonswish{} handles PLP languages that follow the distribution semantics
\cite{DBLP:conf/iclp/Sato95ijar}: a probabilistic program defines a probability
distribution over normal programs called \jargon{instances}
and the probability of a query is the sum
of the probabilities of the instances where the query is true. This approach
has recently gained prominence  and it is adopted by many languages such as
Logic Programs with Annotated
Disjuctions (LPADs) \cite{VenVer04-ICLP04-IC},
ProbLog \cite{DBLP:conf/ijcai/RaedtKT07}
and PRISM \cite{DBLP:conf/iclp/Sato95ijar}.
Programs in any of these languages can be written
in \cplintonswish{}.

Each language offers the possibility
of expressing probabilistic choices: for example, LPADs allow disjunctions
in the head of clauses where each disjunct is annotated with a probability, the
meaning of a clause of this form being that if the body is true, then one of
the head atoms is true with its corresponding probability.

In PLP the reasoning tasks are inference, parameter learning and structure
learning. In inference, the aim is to compute the probability of a query,
possibly given some evidence, from a program. Generating all possible instances
is not viable because there is an exponential number of them so smarter
algorithms must be adopted. One of the most successful approaches is
\jargon{knowledge compilation}, where the program is compiled into an
intermediate language from which the computation of the probability is easy.
\cplintonswish{} includes the PITA algorithm \cite{RigSwi13-TPLP-IJ}
that compiles the program to a BDD and computes the
probability with a dynamic programming algorithm. However, exact inference is
intractable in general so approximate algorithms have been developed.
\cplintonswish{} includes MCINTYRE \cite{Rig13-FI-IJ} that uses a Monte Carlo
approach: the algorithm repeatedly samples  the truth value of the query
and
the probability of the query is given by the relative frequency of the true
value.

In parameter learning, the user has a program for which he does not know
the probabilistic parameters and wants to learn them from data.
In structure learning, the user wants to learn both the structure of the
clauses and the parameters from data.
In \cplintonswish{} learning can be performed from
sets of interpretations, each expressing a possible state of the world.
Some predicates are identified as target and true and false atoms for it
in the
interpretations are used as positive and negative examples respectively.
Parameter learning needs an EM algorithm, as the model includes unobserved
variables. EMBLEM \cite{BelRig13-IDA-IJ} is available in \cplintonswish{} and
uses a special dynamic programming algorithm operating on BDDs for implementing
EM.
For structure learning, \cplintonswish{} includes SLIPCOVER
\cite{BelRig15-TPLP-IJ} that performs a beam search in the space of clauses
and scores them using the log likelihood of the data after parameter learning
by EMBLEM, and LEMUR \cite{DBLP:journals/ml/MauroBR15} that is similar
to SLIPCOVER but uses Monte Carlo tree search.

All the algorithms are available as modules to be loaded in a regular Prolog
input file. Each module offers directives to separate various sections of the
source with different roles: for example, for holding the probabilistic logic
program for inference or parameter learning or the background knowledge for
parameter or structure learning.
These directives are handled using term_expansion/2 and activate or deactivate
other term_expansion/2 clauses that process the probabilistic clauses and
transform them into Prolog clauses to be used by the  algorithms.

The modules were adapted for the multi-user context
of \cplintonswish{}. The modules use asserts to store information in the
database: these asserts
are now performed in the module that is created for the individual pengine.
This module is obtained in term_expansion/2 clauses using the predicate
prolog_load_context/2 that is available during compilation and that
can return the module where the code is being loaded.
The pengine module name is
temporarily stored in the algorithm module during compilation but is
insulated from other input files using the thread_local/1 directive
and is removed at the end of compilation.
During execution of
the algorithms all asserts are performed in the temporary pengine
module and discarded at the end of the computation.

The name of the pengine module is necessary to execute the
predicates that are offered by the inference and learning modules,
so all inference and learning predicates are declared as meta
using the directive meta_predicate/1,
with one argument indicated as module-sensitive. In this way the algorithm
predicates can operate on the data stored in the pengine module.

\cplintonswish{} includes many examples of inference from various domains:
reasoning about actions,
random walks,
marketing,
natural language,
biology,
puzzles,
genetics,
model checking,
medicine,
games,
social networks,
filtering,
Bayesian estimation and
regression.
These examples show the various features of the inference modules:
encoding Markov Logic Networks and stochastic logic programs,
continuous random variables,
particle filtering,
likelihood weighting,
Metropolis-Hastings sampling,
rejection sampling,
argument sampling,
causal inference and
computation of expectations.

\cplintonswish{} exploits the graphics capabilities of SWISH.
For example, Figure \ref{fig:cplint-path} shows a program
for the computation of the probability of the existence of a
path between two nodes in a probabilistic graph
(also known as the \jargon{network reliability problem}).
The graphviz rendering library
of SWISH is used to draw the probabilistic graph.
The same library is used to draw the BDD that is built by
the PITA for answering a query.

    \caption{Screendump of \cplintonswish{} with opened
    probabilistic graph example.}
    \label{fig:cplint-path}
\end{figure}

\cplintonswish{} also uses the R for SWISH library
that allows the use of R both for computation and for
grphics. The code for interfacing \cplint{} with R
is included in the \verb|cplint_r|\footnote{\url{http://www.swi-prolog.org/pack/list?p=cplint_r}}
SWI-Prolog pack. Figure \ref{fig:cplint-kalman} presents
a one-dimensional Kalman filter example with a graph
that shows how the probability density on the position
of the target changes with time.
\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figs/cplint-kalman}
    \caption{Screendump of \cplintonswish{} with opened
    Kalman filter example together with the results of
    a MCINTYRE query graphed with R.}
    \label{fig:cplint-kalman}
\end{figure}

SWISH also offers the possibility of adding rendering libraries.
\cplintonswish{} for example adds a library for drawing
two dimensional tile maps. Figure \ref{fig:cplint-map}
shows an example for the random generation of two-dimensional
tile maps for video games, together with a randomly generated
map.
\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figs/cplint-map}
    \caption{Screendump of \cplintonswish{} with opened
    tile map generation example.}
    \label{fig:cplint-map}
\end{figure}

\cplintonswish{} also includes learning examples, both for
parameter learning and for structure learning with SLIPCOVER
and LEMUR: predicting  whether a machine should be fixed,
classifying  pictures containing geometrical objects
(Bongard problems),
predicting the shopping behavior of people,
learning the parameters of a hidden Markov model,
predicting whether a molecule is an active mutagenic agent
(the famous mutagenesis benchmark dataset),
predicting the rating of courses of a university
and learning the probabilistic effects of actions in the Event Calculus.

The learned programs are shown in the answer pane using a specific
rendering library and can be applied to a testing set. Data
analysts  often find useful to
draw the Received Operating Characteristic (ROC)
and Precision Recall (PR) curves of the performance of a model
on the test set and to compute
the areas under these curves. \cplintonswish{} includes
the \verb|auc|
SWI-Prolog pack for such purpose and can draw the curves using
either R or C3.js: for example, Figure \ref{fig:cplint-auc}
shows a ROC curve drawn with R.
\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figs/cplint-auc}
    \caption{Screendump of \cplintonswish{} with opened
    ROC and PR curves example.}
    \label{fig:cplint-auc}
\end{figure}

\cplintonswish{} also includes Aleph \cite{aleph}, one of the most
influential Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) systems. It learns
normal logic programs from examples and background knowledge and
can be used as a baseline for probabilistic ILP systems.
Aleph has been ported from Yap to SWI-Prolog and transformed into a
module with conditional compilation directives as the \cplint{}
algorithms in order to work in SWISH. It is now available
as a SWI-Prolog pack.

\cplintonswish{} offers program and notebook profiles for each of
the inference and learning algorithms containing code skeletons
for using the algorithms. The syntax highlighter of SWISH was extended
to correctly
evidence the probabilistic constructs.
