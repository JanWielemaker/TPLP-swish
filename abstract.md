Title:

Using SWISH to realise an interactive web based tutorial for logic based
languages

Abstract:

Programming environments have evolved from purely text based to
graphical user interfaces while we now see a move towards web based
interfaces such as Jupyter. Web based interfaces allow for creating an
interactive document that consists of text, programs as well as their
output. The output can be rendered using web technology as, e.g., text,
tables, charts or graphs. This approach is particularly suitable for
capturing data analysis workflows and creating interactive educational
material. This article describes SWISH, a web frontend for Prolog that
consists of a web server implemented in SWI-Prolog and a client web
application written in JavaScript. SWISH provides a web server where
multiple users can manipulate and run the same material. SWISH can be
adapted to support Prolog extensions such as probabilistic logic
programs or Logic Production System (LPS). We describe the architecture
of SWISH and how the system can be used to create a tutorial site for
two derived languages.
